% list of values that contain the possible responses when the user is seding his/her greeting. 
% the possible types of greetings are alos different from people to people, so I just listed a few under "list_of_greetings" 
% one of the responses will be randomly picked up by the bot as a response. Makes it more fun than just giving one answer everytime.
list_of_responses(sayingHi, [
    ['Hello!'], 
    ['Hi!'], 
    ['What is up'], 
    ['Morning'],
    ['Good Morning'],
    ['Afternoon'],
    ['What is Good!'],
    ['Good afternoon!'],
    ['Hi, dear'],
    ['Hello, sir'],
    ['Hello, maam'],
    ['Good evening']

    ]).

% this is the list_of_greetings I have mentioned above. It contains the possible ways people might greet to the bot.
list_of_greetings([
    hey, 
    yo, 
    hello,
    hi,
    hola
    ]).

% below, I have mentioned some of the ways the bot can respond when the user is saying bye. 
list_of_responses(sayingBye, [
    ['Bye!'], 
    ['See you!'], 
    ['Ciao!'], 
    ['Later!'], 
    ['Talk later!']
    ]).

% here I have included the possible lists of responses when the user inputs a course that doesn't match the one we have in store. 
% the logic of checking if the item exists or not is inside the chatbot.pl, so you can easily map back and see what I did.

list_of_responses(responseToInputCourses, [
    ['I guess, you migth have made a mistake. Check again.'],
    ['I do not know that subject for Cs and AI majors. Maybe try again will small letters only.'],
    ['I blieve that is not one of the CS and AI requirements.'],
    ['Maybe you are inserting couses from electives. Please stay in College of Computational Sciences only.'],
    ['I would appreciate it very much if you provide me a proper answer']
    ]).

% here I have mentioned the required CS courses that one need to take as a CS and AI concentration - this excludes electives as electives might vary. 
% what I mean is that if we include elective, we will have to include anything but not CS, and that defeats the purpose of the term "required." - because it implies that almost every course outside of CS college is also required.
% so, I am going to stick with courses from CS.

% below, I have included lists of reponses for the bot to pick up and repond to when the user sends gratitude.
% since the way the user sends gratitude is not one fixed word, I have compiled I think people use to send gratitudes in chats(but I know people use so may different expressions beyond these).
% I have stored that inside the list_of_gratitudes

%  here, I have included the responses for the bot to choose from to make the conversation active and two-sided. 
% this way the chat will also ask some random questions in the middle of the conversations the way normal human beings do. 
% this way, the user won't be bored with a straight back and forth conversation with a machine.
